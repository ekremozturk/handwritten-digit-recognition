# handwritten-digit-recognition
### abstract


We are at the century of data. Agents (cell phones, computers, surveillence cameras) around us are constantly gathering information. In 2020, collected data estimated to be approximately 40000 exabytes. Data is very important for training artificial agents. As we learn through out experiencing, they learn through data. Ironically their infinite life is very short for the market to learn slowly by experiencing. Fortunately, developments in the technology and increase in the size of collected data allows us to interpret huge data, teach our models to classify etc. Handwritten digit recognition is de facto in data science and in this project I compare different models and obtain up to 99.57 % prediction accuracy.
